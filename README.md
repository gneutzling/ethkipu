# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gabriel

I'm a frontend developer who enjoys building modern and clean web applications.  
Most of the time I work with **React**, **Next.js**, and **GraphQL**, but Iâ€™m always curious to explore new tools and ideas.

ðŸš€ **Currently exploring**
- Web3 development: smart contracts, dApps, and blockchain integrations  
- Building decentralized apps with Ethereum & Solidity  
- Bringing smooth frontend experiences to the decentralized web

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals in Web3**
- Combine my frontend expertise with blockchain to create great user experiences
- Build tools that make Web3 more accessible  
- Contribute to open-source projects in the ecosystem

ðŸŒ± **Other interests**
- Backend development  
- AI experiments  
- Teaching and helping new developers

ðŸ“‚ **About this repository**  
This is where Iâ€™ll keep my experiments and projects from the **[ETH Kipu](https://ethkipu.org/)** course.  
Itâ€™s a space for testing ideas, learning Web3 concepts, and building small prototypes using Solidity, Ethereum, and related tools.
